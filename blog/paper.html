  <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
  <p>
  A: I am already familiar with the teachings laid out in the chapter as I have read books and watched videos that teach similar things. The teaching typically revolves around meditation and training the mind to be more calm. This is a skill like any other and it takes time to develop however its effects can be felt quick quickly when put into practise.

  <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
  <p>
  A: I typically try to do 10 minutes of meditation each night so I know that this can be very relaxing but it can also be difficult at times as the mind has a tendency to want to think all the time. I found the 2 minute exercise to be calming but the advice of deep breathing during an emotional charged situation is also a great idea.
