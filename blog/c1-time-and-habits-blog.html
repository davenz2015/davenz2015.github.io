     <h1>Reflections on time and habit techniques</h1>

        <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try</h2>
          <p>I've tried the Pomodoro technique which I quite like because it's a regular thing that's already set up and requires no thinking, otherwise nothing regular will happen. I've also tried Timeboxing and Tiny Habits. 

        <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
          <p>Pomodoro worked for me because its the easiest to implement.</p>

        <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
          <p>I like the sound of scientifically growing more gray matter, so meditation and mindfulness are on the list. Knowing about the Growth vs Fixed mindset is useful to be aware of. Implementing Tiny Habits to establish a habit sounds like something I will try too, and I'll continue with the Pomodoro Technique. </p>
