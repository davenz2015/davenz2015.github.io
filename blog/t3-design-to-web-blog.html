      <h1>Design To Web</h1>
      <h3>week 3</h3>

          <h2>What is a responsive site is, and why is responsiveness important?</h2>
            <p>A responsive site is one that changes size depending on the size of the browser and you can see most everything on the screen no matter what size device you are using. It is easy to read and navigate and there is not much scrolling.
            </p> 

          <h2>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h2>
            <p>As the term implies, this is where sites are designed for mobile devices and users first, before desktops and larger devices. Its come about because most people these days access the internet from mobile devices and its alot easier to add more content as you go to larger browsers than the other way around.
            </p>

          <h2>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</h2>
            <p>A framework is by definition a supporting structure around which thing can be built. Regarding software its a generic software that when you add your code to it you can use for supporting the development of websites. 
            The advantage is that its standardized and quick and you dont have to develop any software.
            The drawbacks are that you have to learn how to use it and what its best uses are, for really small projects you might be better off taking a customised approach, it cant do everything, and it is public so baddies might try to exploit it.
            </p> 

          <h2>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h2>
            <p>A wireframe is basically a screen blueprint of your website. Really basically its just a non-detailed simple outline sketch.
            </p>
       
          <h3 class="topframes">My Wireframes</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="three columns">
            <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.JPG" alt="wireframe picture moblie" class="rotate90">
          </div>
          <div class="three columns">
            <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.JPG" alt="wireframe picture desktop" class="rotate90">
          </div>
          <div class="three columns">
            <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.JPG" alt="wireframe picture moblie" class="rotate90">
          </div>
          <div class="three columns">
            <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.JPG" alt="wireframe picture desktop" class="rotate90">
          </div>
        </div>

          <h2 class="bottomframes">The aspects of your wireframes did you find difficult to implement, and why?</h2>
            <p>With no experience of layouts and endless options I found myself spending quite a bit of time completing the exercise in the suggested timeframe and was trying too much to get it right. Not alot of iteration going on. Also, what I liked in desktop view wasnt related to what I liked in mobile view. Decisions decisions. Starting with min basics like a header and footer helped.
            Next time I think Ill brainstorm and run off quite a few layouts and then pick the ones I like from there. I think that will save me alot of time.
