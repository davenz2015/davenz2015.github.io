        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

        <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2>
          <p>
            I understand that we are to do process over product - that the focus is on learning vs producing and that we are to be engaging with the material, even if nothing is working perfectly, and thats ok. But I still wanted to do more than just have a play and not have a working site, so I went over the timebox limit. I see the value of playing, trying things, that it might not perfect, but I had more than the allocated time available so I used it. The other thing with the focusing on learning is doing just that, and if you hit a problem, get the obstacle out of the way as fast as you can and get back to learning - that part I didnt do so well at. I have a tendency to stay doing something until it works. I dont want to hit a problem and then straight away ask for help and get someone else to give me an answer immediately either. The article that says if youre really stuck on a problem, then give yourself another solid fifteen minutes and if you still don't have an answer after 15 minutes, you must ask someone, is good advice. "You must try, and then you must ask." sounds like the middle ground I need to take. Alot more efficient too!

        <h2>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h2>
          <p>
            Not too much, its not something I have had an interest in. Eastern religion practice.
          </p>

        <h2>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h2>
          <p>
            I learnt that it can grow your brain and increase concentration. Chade-Meng Tan also claims that it brings clarity and happiness, you get sick less, smile more and it improves your social life. Leo Babauta says that decluttering your life a bit will do the same. Probably take longer than 2 minutes per day though! 
          </p> 

        <h2>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h2>
          <p>
            Well, being alert and relaxed at the same time sounds like a good thing. Making the point of regaining attention once it has slipped to develop your concentration focus. Better concentration sounds great.
