        <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
          <p>Grid based design is where in graphic design the webpage is broken into a grid type structure made up of vertical and horizontal lines which are used to help structure content. The grid makes a framework on which you can easily organise elements.

        <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
          <p>Responsive web pages are pages that respond to the size of the device you are using and change their width or re-size depending on the size of the browser being used.
          </p>

        <h2>What is Semantic structure?</h2>
          <p>Semantic structure is where we use semantic html to reinforce the meaning of the information on the page rahter than just define the look of the page. They are elements with a meaning - for example an image tag, whereas a div tag tells us nothing about it's content.
          </p>
        <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h2>
          <p>I like the thought that any problem we have has been solved before! Yay!</p>
