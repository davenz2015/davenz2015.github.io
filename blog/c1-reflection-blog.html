    <h1>Shareef's Fireside Chat</h1>

    <h2>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h2>
        <p>It seems to be analagous to what I think the I.T. industry is like - constantly changing and improving. They sound like they have the goal to produce I.T. candidates that have all the good traits that an employer would consider really valuable, and they can code too!</p>

    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
        <p>Get up to speed in a hurry! in seven words. Immerse yourself into the experience as quickly as you can. There is a heavy bias on emotional intelligence. Coding and I.Q. are somewhat secondary.</p>

    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
        <p>With a bit of a culture shock - sounds great and I can see the opportunities for growth but it will be a bit of a challenge. Change always is. Having a safe learning environment is good </p>

    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        <p>Yes they have. Being responsible for your own learning an not having a typical western world 'restaurant mindset' is the main expectation that has changed. Take full control of your own education.s</p>

    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        <p>I am quite eager to participate because of what will hopefully be at the end of the course. And I am a little bit nervous because of the hopefully part.</p>
